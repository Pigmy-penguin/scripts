# Flashell
This script reads a deck.csv in [fla.sh](https://github.com/tallguyjenks/fla.sh) format
You can typically source it inside your .bashrc to show up a flascard and its answer everytime you run a shell

#### Flashcards are formatted like so:
``category:question:answer:0``

#### My english vocabulary flashcards format (which this script was designed for):
``english:What does "ENGLISH-WORD" mean?:FRENCH-WORD,ANOTHER-FRENCH-WORD:0``
